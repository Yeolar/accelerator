# Defines the target "accelerator::accelerator"
# Add this to your target_link_libraries() call to depend on accelerator.
#
# Also sets the variables ACCELERATOR_INCLUDE_DIR and ACCELERATOR_LIBRARY.
# However, in most cases using the accelerator::accelerator target is sufficient,
# and you won't need these variables.
